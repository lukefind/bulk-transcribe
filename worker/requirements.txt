# GPU Worker dependencies
# Note: torch and torchaudio are installed separately in Dockerfile
# to control CUDA vs CPU wheel selection per architecture

# DEPENDENCY RATIONALE (2024-01):
# - numpy 1.26.4: Last 1.x release, compatible with torch 2.2.2 and pyannote
# - torch 2.2.2 + torchaudio 2.2.2: Installed in Dockerfile with CUDA 12.1 wheels
# - openai-whisper 20231117: Stable release, requires numpy and torch
# - pyannote.audio 3.1.1: Requires numpy, torch, torchaudio
# - huggingface_hub 0.19.4: For model downloads (pyannote needs HF_TOKEN)
#
